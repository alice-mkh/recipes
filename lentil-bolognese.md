# Ingredients

    - 1 ½ tablespoons oil
    - 1 large onion, diced
    - 4 garlic cloves, minced
    - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    - 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or use more oregano)
    - 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
    - Freshly ground black pepper to taste
    - 1 (5.3-ounce) (150g) tube of tomato paste
    - 1/2 cup (120 mL) dry red wine (optional, see note 2)
    - 3 cups (720 mL) vegetable broth or water
    - 1 cup (185g) red lentils, soaked 
    - ¼ cup (32g) walnuts (or pecans), crushed finely
    - 1 (14.5-ounce/410g) can of crushed tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand
    - Flat-leaf Italian parsley or fresh basil, chopped or slivered (optional)

# Instructions

    1. Soak the 1 cup of lentils in water for 30 minutes, or up to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, prep all the other ingredients (i.e., chop the onions and garlic, chop the walnuts, etc.)
    2. Heat a 12-inch deep sauté pan or Dutch oven on medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, and once it’s shimmering, add the onions and season with a pinch of salt. Stir occasionally and cook the onions until a light brown fond starts form on the surface of the pan, about 5 minutes. Add a few spoons of water to deglaze the pan, and stir. Continue cooking the onions, adding more water every few minutes and stirring frequently to prevent burning, until the onions are softened and golden brown, 9-10 minutes.
    3. Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Stir frequently and cook for 60-90 seconds.
    4. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2-3 minutes to caramelize, stirring very frequently, until it’s darker red in color.
    5. Pour in the broth to deglaze the pan, stirring any browned bits on the bottom of the pot and stirring the broth into the tomato paste to combine. Add the lentils and walnuts, and stir to incorporate. Heat until the mixture comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a rapid simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    6. Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for another 15-20 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still al dente, stirring occasionally to prevent burning and sticking.
